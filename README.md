# Mushroom Classification Dataset

## Description
This dataset contains detailed information on various types of mushrooms, focusing on their characteristics for classification purposes. The goal is to determine if a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its attributes. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a specific type of mushroom, characterized by various physical features.

## Columns

- **CLASS**: Indicates whether the mushroom is edible (e) or poisonous (p).
- **CAP_SHAPE**: Describes the shape of the mushroom cap, with various categorical values.
- **CAP_SURFACE**: Describes the surface texture of the mushroom cap.
- **CAP_COLOR**: Specifies the color of the mushroom cap.
- **BRUISES**: Indicates whether the mushroom shows bruises or not.
- **ODOR**: Describes the odor of the mushroom.
- **GILL_ATTACHMENT**: Specifies how the gills are attached to the mushroom cap.
- **GILL_SPACING**: Describes the spacing of the gills.
- **GILL_SIZE**: Indicates the size of the gills.
- **GILL_COLOR**: Specifies the color of the gills.
